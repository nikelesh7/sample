AdHelper Class and Sample CreateJS Banner Ad
=======

Interactive HTML5 banner ad demonstrating use of the AdHelper class.

![ScreenShot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CreateJS/html5ads/master/AdHelper/README_1.jpg)

The AdHelper class is only 2kb over the wire, and provides a number of capabilities for HTML5 banner ads built with
CreateJS:
- detecting if CreateJS is supported on the browser
- displaying alternative content
- pausing & muting while in background tabs
- setting sleep schedules (ex. pause after 15s)
- waking on interaction for configurable time
- ensure full resolution graphics on high DPI screens
- performance monitoring
- time syncing content

See the documentation in `/docs` and the source of `garyad_deploy.html` for more information.

The interactive sample ad was created entirely as a Flash Pro HTML5 Canvas document, and has a total  "over the wire" 
(gzipped) size of only 66kb (including 25kb of audio), excluding the CDN hosted CreateJS libraries. It uses vector
graphics, to provide high fidelity art on any display.
It was created entirely by a designer / illustrator, including the timeline code for interaction.
